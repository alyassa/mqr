\title{Levene Test of Variance Heterogeneity}
\description{Returns test statistics for Levene's test of variance heterogeneity across genotype categories.}
\usage{Levene(datatable, y, g, covariates=NULL, method="Brown-Forsythe",
                   log.p=FALSE)}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.


\arguments{
  \item{datatable}{An object of class `data.table` containing the data to be analysed with samples in rows and the dependent variable and all independent variables in columns. Ensure all variables are of the correct class (e.g. `numeric`, `factor`)}
  \item{y}{Name (character or string) of the continuous response variable}
  \item{g}{Name (character or string) of the genotype variable (e.g. SNP)}
  \item{covariates}{Name (character or string) of any additional variables (covariates) to fit the model. NOTE : here linear model will be fit with covariates and levene test will be performed on residuals from the linear model}
  \item{method}{Two options are implemented, "Classic-Levene"  and "Brown-Forsythe" modification. The former is known to be prone to elevated type 1 error when response is skewed while the latter is robust to skew.
  \item{log.p}{return log of p-value?}}
